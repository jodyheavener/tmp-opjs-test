# opjs-test

Testing out [op-js](https://github.com/1Password/op-js).

```shell
# install deps
yarn

# run example script
yarn start
```

You will be prompted to auth, and then you should see an output like:

> Hello, user@example.com!
>
> You have 2 items in the "Foo" vault.
>
> Here's a random one: in this vault, the item "Bar" has 3 fields.
